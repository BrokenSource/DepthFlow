# ⚡️ Quick start

<b><span class="the">T</span>his section</b> focus on getting started with DepthFlow, demonstrating basic usage, commands, and features. The main goal is to help you create your first 3D parallax effect videos quickly and easily, from the command line, web interface, or custom scripts.

<h3>Before continuing:</h3>

From any installation method, you can simply run `depthflow` or double click the executables to see all top-most available commands (entry points). You should see something like:

</div>

You can run any of the commands above plus `#!ps --help` to list all options for that command.

For example, `depthflow gradio --help` will show all options for the web interface, running `depthflow --help` will show all CLI options (as is the default command).
