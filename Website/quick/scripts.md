Talk is cheap, and if you're here, you know what you want ðŸ˜…

- All scripts below are self-explanatory: <sup>hopefully</sup>

### Simplest

!!! example "This simplest script is the same as running the main entry point directly"
    ```python
    {% include-markdown "../../depthflow/examples/basic.py" %}
    ```

### Custom

!!! example "You can create custom animations, and manage/automate everything within Python"
    ```python
    {% include-markdown "../../depthflow/examples/custom.py" %}
    ```

### Complex

??? example "This monstruous script combines batch and parallel processing, animation variations"
    ```python
    {% include-markdown "../../depthflow/examples/complex.py" %}
    ```

{% include-markdown "include/love-short.md" %}
