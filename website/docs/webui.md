✅ On any installation method, you can run `depthflow gradio` to start the gradio web interface. This will open a new tab in your default browser hosted in your local machine.

📁 **Input any image** on the top left, optionally upscale it; change the animations and/or configure rendering options; hit _"Render"_ to generate a video!

♻️ **You can pass** a `depthflow gradio --share` flag to have a temporary _public link_ of your instance, _proxied_ through [**Gradio**](https://www.gradio.app/)'s servers. Do this when hosting for a friend, or if you don't have access to the local network of a remote/rented server!
