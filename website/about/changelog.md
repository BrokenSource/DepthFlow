    - Overhauled the Readme and the WebUI layout and content
    - Improvements to perceptual quality of the animation presets
    - Add [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl) as an upscaler option
    - Add a command line interface for all upscalers and depth estimators
    - Fixed drag and drop of files due new lazy loading logic
    - Add stretch detection math on the shader for potential fill-in with gen ai
    - Add colors filters (sepia, grayscale, saturation, contrast, brightness)
    - Add transverse lens distortion filter (intensity, decay options)
    - Overhaul animation system to be more flexible and reliable
    - Reorganize website examples section into their own pages
    - Cached depthmaps are now handled by `diskcache` for safer cross-process
    - Refactor the shader for future include system external usage
    - Simplify how the ray intersections are computed with ray marching
    - Fix how projection rays are calculated, as `steady`, `focus` were slightly wrong
    - Fix base scene duration is now 5 seconds

### üì¶ v0.8.0 <small>October 27, 2024</small> {#0.8.0}
